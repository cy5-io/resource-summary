# aws-resource-counter
This command line tool counts the number of resources in different categories across the Amazon regions provided by the user.

This is a simple Python script that will count resources across different regions and display them on the command line. It first takes the input of regions from the user and then displays the resource count for each of the following resource on the screen. At last, it also shows the total resource count of region-specefic resources and also, the global resources such as IAM, Cloudfront etc. 

Following are the resources that this tool shows the resource count of:

* IAM Users
* IAM Groups
* IAM Roles
* Cloudfront Distributions
* s3 buckets
* Subnets
* VPCs
* VPC Endpoints
* EC2 Instances
* Security Groups
* Route Tables
* EBS Volumes
* EBS Snapshots
* Network Load Balancers
* Application Load Balancers
* Lambda functions
* SQS Queues
* DynamoDB Tables
* DynamoDB Global Tables
* RDS Clusters
* RDS Instances
* RDS DB Snapshots
* ElasticSearch Domain Names
* Elasticache Clusters
* Redshift Clusters
* ECR Repositories
* EKS Clusters
* ECS Clusters
* DocumentDB Clusters
* Neptune DB Clusters
* Kinesis Streams
* API Gateway Rest APIs
* Kafka Clusters

## Usage:

To install just copy it where you want it and instally the requirements:

	pip install -r requirements.txt

To run:

	python3 resource_count.py 

It will use the AWS credentials that are already configured on the system. 
It only neeeds the SecurityAudit managed policy.

## Sample Output:
